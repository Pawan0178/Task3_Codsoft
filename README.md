The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning problem that involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This problem is widely used in data science and machine learning for educational purposes because of its simplicity and the well-structured dataset.

Project Overview:
Dataset: The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length (in cm)
Sepal Width (in cm)
Petal Length (in cm)
Petal Width (in cm)
Goal: The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify a given iris flower into one of the three species based on its features.

Steps Involved:

Data Preprocessing: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize feature distributions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use data visualization techniques like scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots to explore the relationships between features.
Feature Selection: Utilize feature engineering techniques to determine the most relevant features for classification.
Model Selection: Train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to determine the best-performing model.

Outcome: The project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in classifying iris species, making it a great starting point for beginners in machine learning.
